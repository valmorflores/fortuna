#  C53BLMID.LNK - 95.04.25 Version 1.0
#
#  Blinker link script for CA-Clipper 5.3 - medium amount of overlaid code.
#
#  This script may help with tight memory situations, and when using the
#  Clipper debugger (CLDR) with large programs.
#
#  For ease of use this script should be stored in your library directory,
#  (the directory pointed to by the LIB environment variable), which will allow
#  Blinker to find the script without you having to specify a full path.
#
#  This script MUST be included outside of any BEGINAREA / ENDAREA commands
#  and after all libraries except the RDDs and LLIBCE if it is being used.
#
#  example:
#
#  FILE one
#  BEGINAREA
#       FILE two
#       FILE three
#       FILE four
#  ENDAREA
#  @C53BLMID
#  LIB DBFCDX
#  LIB LLIBCE # (if used)
#
#  Modules within CLIPPER.LIB are, by their nature, called very frequently
#  within any CLIPPER application. Therefore, overlaying these routines
#  will almost certainly result in some performance degradation, which can
#  be minimised by increasing the OVERLAY OPSIZE.
#
#  You may also wish to consider using BLINKER OVERLAY PAGEFRAME ON to expand
#  the overlay pool to 64K, and remove it from conventional memory, to both
#  increase available memory and performance.
#
#  ie BLINKER OVERLAY PAGEFRAME ON
#
#  Specifying an overlay cache will increase execution speed significantly.
#
#  eg BLINKER CACHE XMS 256
#     BLINKER CACHE EMS 256
#
#  The amount of performance degradation will vary from application to
#  application, - it may be necessary to modify this script by commenting
#  out some MODULE statements to increase performance to an acceptable level
#  in some areas.
#
#  Please note that some third party libraries may replace or modify routines
#  in the CLIPPER library, so that they are no longer overlayable. The link
#  time command BLINKER MESSAGE DUPLICATES may help in determining such
#  conflicts or replacements.
#
#
# mod tbrowse0          #  Uncomment these three lines
# mod tbrowse1          #  to speed up TBROWSE by forcing
# mod linelen           #  it into the root.
